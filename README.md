    I created a four-panel yonkoma comic where a stick figure interacts with an AI-generated image that has an absurd number of fingers. The humor      comes from the stick figure earnestly commenting on how realistic the AI image looks, oblivious to its glaring anatomical mistakes.

Figure 1. This is my 4-comma, explain what this 4-comma is trying to encaptulate. *Ensure your image is high-definition, with a width greater than 3500 pixels. If your imafe is not wide enough, it will not fill the page!

## Abstract
Your abstract here: 50 words here.

As AI integrates into daily life, its misinterpretations reveal limitations and risks. This paper examines AI-generated errors through a case study of a misinterpreted cooking request. These mistakes underscore the need for human oversight, as unchecked AI content can lead to misinformation, flawed decisions, and misplaced trust in algorithms.

Example of how to make a list:
There are many great README templates available on GitHub.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

As an artist carving my own path in the creative world, I constantly push myself to think beyond conventions and expand the boundaries of my art. However, with the rise of generative AI, maintaining authenticity has become increasingly challenging.

I’m drawn to this concept because it reflects the ongoing struggle between human creativity and machine-generated content. AI’s ability to mimic artistic styles raises questions about originality, ownership, and artistic intent. Over time, I’ve observed how AI has evolved from a mere tool to a collaborator—or even a competitor—in creative fields.
Manga is an ideal medium to explore this tension because of its expressive visual language and ability to balance humor, drama, and critique. Through dynamic paneling, exaggerated expressions, and visual metaphors, I can illustrate AI’s occasional absurdities while emphasizing the irreplaceable human touch in art.
To create these images, I will use digital illustration tools like adobe photoshop alongside AI-assisted design programs. While digital tools enhance efficiency and precision, AI-generated elements pose both opportunities and challenges—sometimes aiding creativity, but also raising concerns about artistic integrity. The history of digital illustration, from early raster programs to AI-driven tools, underscores this evolving relationship between artists and technology.

What draws you to this concept, and how has it developed
over time? How do you intend to convey your idea through
manga, and why do you believe this is the most effective
medium? What technology will you employ to create these
images or concepts, and how has this technology been
beneficial or challenging? Please include the development and
history of the technology you are using.

Here I talk about how these works have paved the way for my project. Recent research shows that sense of belonging is evoked when using mixed realty [1], and my work is inspired by this xyz. Another recent project examines the beauty of symmetry in evolution [2] that my work highlights in my 4-comma cell number 4. 
Notable work by Kamp in 2019, highlights the beauty that could be found in nature and how it connects to design [3] and my work show the influence of that visual in 4-comma cell number 3.

## Methodology

Your Methodology and Related Works here: 200 words here.

To achieve my artistic vision, I started by outlining my thoughts on Artificial Intelligence, focusing on how human critical thinking is still essential when working with AI. I chose to explore this theme through yonkoma, a four-panel manga style known for its concise, humorous storytelling.
My process began with research into yonkoma's structure, which helped me design the flow of the narrative. I then created traditional sketches for the characters and overall composition. This step was important in figuring out a basic composition and understanding of flow. 
For dialogue, I used ChatGPT to iterate different conversation options that aligned with my theme of basic common sense. I also generated an AI image for one of the panels, using AI to enhance the visuals without compromising the hand-drawn aesthetic.
