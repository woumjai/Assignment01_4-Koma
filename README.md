  <p align="center">
    I created a four-panel yonkoma comic where a stick figure interacts with an AI-generated image that has an absurd number of fingers. The humor      comes from the stick figure earnestly commenting on how realistic the AI image looks, oblivious to its glaring anatomical mistakes.

Figure 1. This is my 4-comma. The idea is to understand that while AI is increasingly getting more realistic, it's still not real and that we as a user still need to understand that anything out of AI can be considered an interpertation on life. 

<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract

This paper examines AI-generated errors through a case study of an image-generation mistake, where an AI-created portrait features an excessive number of fingers while maintaining realistic textures and lighting. These anatomical distortions reveal flaws in AI’s pattern recognition and inability to grasp human aesthetics, underscoring the need for oversight to prevent misinformation and misplaced trust.

## Introduction and Related Works

As an artist, I constantly push myself to think beyond conventions and expand the boundaries of my work. However, with the rise of generative AI, maintaining authenticity has become increasingly challenging as AI blurs the line between human craftsmanship and machine production. Kate Crawford’s Atlas of AI explores how AI is not just a neutral tool but a system shaped by power, labor, and biases—raising concerns about its role in creative fields [1].

AI’s ability to replicate artistic styles often leads to bizarre distortions—such as extra fingers or unnatural anatomy—while raising questions about originality and artistic intent. Over time, I’ve observed AI evolve from a simple tool to a collaborator—or even an unintentional parody—of artistic expression.

Manga is an ideal medium to explore this tension because of its expressive visual language and ability to balance humor, drama, and critique. Through dynamic paneling, exaggerated expressions, and visual metaphors, I can highlight AI’s absurdities while emphasizing the irreplaceable human touch in art.

Using digital illustration tools like Adobe Photoshop alongside AI-assisted design programs, I aim to examine both the opportunities and flaws of AI-generated content. As Crawford argues, AI is deeply embedded in social and economic structures, making its impact on art an urgent and complex issue.

## Methodology

To achieve my artistic vision, I started by outlining my thoughts on Artificial Intelligence, focusing on how human critical thinking is still essential when working with AI. I chose to explore this theme through yonkoma, a four-panel manga style known for its concise, humorous storytelling.
My process began with research into yonkoma's structure, which helped me design the flow of the narrative. I then created traditional sketches for the characters and overall composition. This step was important in figuring out a basic composition and understanding of flow. 
For dialogue, I used ChatGPT to iterate different conversation options that aligned with my theme of basic common sense. I also generated an AI image for one of the panels, asking specifically to add more fingers.

The outcome of my project successfully reflected my vision by using manga to highlight the tension between human creativity and AI-generated content. The humor and exaggerated visuals effectively illustrated the absurdities of AI, like its anatomical mistakes, while emphasizing the human touch. If I were to do it again, I would focus on a different narrative that better addresses the topic or push the outlandishness of the subject further. The project could be expanded by exploring other mediums or incorporating deeper narratives that challenge AI’s role in artistic authorship and originality.

## Conclusion

This project highlighted the uncanny flaws of AI-generated art, especially its tendency to create distorted anatomy, like extra fingers. The most memorable moment was crafting the stick figure’s oblivious reaction, emphasizing how AI errors can go unnoticed. This reinforced the need for critical awareness of AI’s limitations in creative fields.
